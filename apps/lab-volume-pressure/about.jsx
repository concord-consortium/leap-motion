      <p>Gases can be compressed into smaller volumes. How does compressing a gas affect its pressure?</p>

      <p>
        Run the model, then change the volume of the containers and observe the change in pressure.
        The moving wall converts the effect of molecular collisions into pressure and acts as a pressure gauge.
        What happens to the pressure when the volume changes?

      <p><b>Note: Although the atoms in this model are in a flat plane, volume is calculated using 0.1 nm as the depth of the container.</b></p>
