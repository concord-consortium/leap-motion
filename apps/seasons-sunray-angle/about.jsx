      <h3>Seasons</h3>
      <p>
      Why are summers in the North warm and winters cold?
      </p><p>
      Explore the views of this simulation to give you clues to answer this question using a Leap Motion controller. The views can show the appearance of the seasons for any day of the year on any place on Earth.
      </p><p>
      The Orbit view shows the motion of the Earth around the sun throughout the year. It is a 3D view that can be tipped and rotated by dragging the scene or the orbit with the mouse. The day of the year can be changed by dragging the Earth.
      </p><p>
      Earth view shows how the Earth would look from outer space for the set day of the year. Drag the Earth to change the view of it. The location of the season is set by dragging the “dot” or the “ring” around the latitude of the Earth.
      </p><p>
      Use your hands to change the sun angle in both the Ground and Space views. The ground view shows the angle that sun rays makes with the surface when looking from the surface of the Earth. The Space view shows the angle of sun rays looking from space. Follow the prompts to change the sun angle in two different ways: By tipping one hand you can change the angle at which the sun hits the Earth. By changing the space between two hands, you can change the spacing between the rays which varies the intensity of the rays. Note how the orbit changes as the sun angle or sun intensity changes.
      </p><p>
      What is the relationship between the sun’s angle with the Earth’s surface and the season? What makes the angle change throughout the year?
