      <h3>Heat Transfer</h3>
      <p>
        Explore the molecular nature of temperature and heat with this simulation using a Leap Motion Controller attached to the computer.
      </p><p>
      The molecules of two masses are displayed with a separation between them. Use your hands to control the temperature of each mass following the prompts on the screen.
      </p><p>
      Try describing temperature based on the motion of molecules. Start with the masses unconnected using the Vacuum setting. How is the molecules’ movement different when hot or cold? How does the motion of your hands correspond to the temperature and the motion of the molecules?
      </p><p>
      Explore heat transfer by selecting either Thick long bar or Thin long bar. This connects the two masses with molecules like the bowl of a spoon and its handle. Describe what happens when the masses connect.
